# easy-utils
> More tools / scripts are still being made and will be collated in this repository. <br>
> Last Update: 16 April 2025

A collection of my favourite tools / utilities for productivity that can be ran locally.

# Requirements
- Some of the tools require certain Python libraries to be installed. Check each file specifically for what to install.
- Some of the tools, since free, may have rate limits as they depend on the Free Tier of some APIs.
